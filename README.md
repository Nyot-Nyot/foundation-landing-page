# Landing Page - The Odin Project
This repository contains the code for the landing page project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Curriculum.


## Project Description
This landing page project aims to replicate a design provided by The Odin Project. The main goal is to create a static webpage that closely resembles the provided design using only HTML and CSS. While the design should be followed as closely as possible, it does not need to be pixel perfect. Variations and customizations can be made freely, as the focus is on learning HTML and CSS rather than strict adherence to the design.
